# cutting-metal-surplus

The Cutting Metal Surplus problem is a classic optimization problem that involves cutting metal rods into smaller pieces to maximize profit. The problem assumes that a metal supplier has a set of metal rods of various lengths and wants to cut them into smaller pieces to sell. The supplier can cut each rod into any number of pieces, but each cut has a cost associated with it. The supplier also has a sale price for each piece of the cut rod.

Given the length of each rod, the cost of making each cut, and the sale price for each piece of the cut rod, the problem is to determine the optimal way to cut the rods to maximize profit.

The approach to solve this problem involves iterating through all possible cut lengths, calculating the number of rods and cuts for each cut length, and then calculating the profit for each cut length. The optimal cut length is the one that results in the highest profit.
